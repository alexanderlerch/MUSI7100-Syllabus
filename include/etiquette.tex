        As a significant part of our communication may remain virtual, I appreciate your cooperation. Please make extensive use of chat and mailing lists to stay in touch with each other. \textbf{Check both Teams and email at least once every business day}.
        Try to actively reach out to me and to your colleagues to help or ask for help. In any remote meetings,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item   please leave your camera on and, in case of more than 4 participants, your microphone off by default,
            \item   feel free to either just speak up or use the chat or raised hands to interrupt.
        \end{itemize}
