    Assignments are due in the language announced (commonly python). The project work can be done in any programming language approved after discussion with the instructor. The most common choices are Python and Matlab. Matlab is accessible at \url{www.matlab.gatech.edu}.
    
    With respect to tools, \textbf{prepare to use github} (github.gatech.edu or github.com or some other version control system). I recommend using the github issues in connection with milestones to keep track of your project progress. Other recommended tools are
    \begin{itemize}
        \item   Zotero for bibliography management, and
        \item   \LaTeX\ for scientific typesetting.
    \end{itemize}
