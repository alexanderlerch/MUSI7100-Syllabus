All graded components will be graded in points. The final grade for the course will be determined by dividing the total points earned by the number of points possible for each of the categories listed above. 

These numbers will be converted into a letter grade according to the following scale: 
    \smallskip
    
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{A} & 100--90\%\\
    \textbf{B} & 89--80\%\\
    \textbf{C} & 79--70\%\\
    \textbf{D} & 69--60\%\\
    \textbf{F} & 59\% and below 
\end{tabular}
    \smallskip
    

Grades may be assigned per group or individually as announced (e.g., projects are in some cases per group, quizzes are usually per individual).
