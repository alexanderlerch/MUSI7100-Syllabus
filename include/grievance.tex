Students should first discuss any concerns with the relevant faculty member; if it is not possible to come to resolution with the faculty member, students may then report the matter to the appropriate administrator (Chair or Associate Chair or Director of Studies) of the department of instruction or report it here: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \url{http://www.contact.gatech.edu/academicgrievance}
        \end{itemize}
