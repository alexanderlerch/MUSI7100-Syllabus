Any student suspected of cheating or plagiarizing on a quiz, exam, or assignment will be reported to the Office of Student Integrity, who will investigate the incident and identify the appropriate penalty for violations.

The use of generative machine learning systems for code and text generation is strongly discouraged as it negates some of the learning outcomes of this class. Note that the student takes full responsibility for factual errors and potential plagiarism in generated text and code.
